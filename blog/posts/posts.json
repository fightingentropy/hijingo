First item\n2. Second item\n   - Sub-item 1\n   - Sub-item 2\n3. Third item\n\n### Code Blocks\n\n```javascript\n// You can add syntax-highlighted code\nfunction greet(name) {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n}\n```\n\n### Links and Images\n\nYou can add [links](https://hijingo.uk) and images:\n\n![Alt text](image-url.jpg)\n\n## Publishing Your Post\n\nAfter writing your post:\n\n1. Save it as a .md file in the `posts` directory\n2. Run `npm run build` to update posts.json\n3. Commit your .md file\n4. Deploy your site\n\nThat's it! Your post will appear on the blog, sorted by date.\n"

Identify your core digital needs\n2. Eliminate unnecessary digital clutter\n3. Optimize your remaining tools\n\nBy following these principles, you'll find yourself more focused, productive, and paradoxically, better connected to what truly matters.\n"
